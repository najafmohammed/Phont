# Phont - Subtitle Animation Project

Phont is a web-based tool that helps to automatically display subtitles with dynamic animations. The project is designed to bring subtitles to life by applying CSS/JS animations, with options to control the animation flow. Users can navigate through subtitles and control playback for a more interactive experience.

## Features

- **Auto Animation**: Subtitles are automatically animated as they appear, using a smooth reveal animation.
- **Dynamic Animation**: Subtitles come with animation effects that trigger when the subtitle first appears. The animation is applied only once.
- **Control for Animation Trigger**: Option to trigger the animation manually using a control button or automatically as the subtitle text changes.
- **Subtitle Navigation**: Click on navigation points to jump directly to specific subtitles.
- **Playback Control**: Use the play, back, and forward buttons to navigate through subtitles and control playback.

- **Subtitle Data**: Currently, subtitle data is loaded directly for immediate display. This could be extended in future versions to support external subtitle sources.

## Setup

To get started with the project locally, follow run these commands on the terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/najafmohammed/Phont.git
